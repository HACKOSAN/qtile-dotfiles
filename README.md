Finally, after many requests, I posted a part of my main configuration files, enjoy it!

**Distro:** Arch Linux \
**WM:** Qtile \
**Shell:** Fish \
**Terminal:** Kitty & Alacritty \
**Multiplexer:** TMUX \
**App Launcher:** Rofi 

*OBS: You'll probably notice some futile aliases and abbrs in my fish config file, anyway, it makes my experience more efficient :)*
